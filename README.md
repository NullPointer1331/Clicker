# Generic Clicker
This is a barebones clicker game made as a way to improve my skills with Android Studio. 
For those that don't know what a clicker game is, [this](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) is an archetypical example. 
Currently, to "play" it, you'll need to open the project in android studio.
